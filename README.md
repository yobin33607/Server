# Byte Labs Server Discord Bot

A clean, lightweight, and feature-rich Discord moderation **and verification** bot built for **Byte Labs**. Powered by `discord.js` v14 with native **slash commands** and a local SQLite database — no external database servers required.

## Features

- **Native slash command system** — All commands use Discord's built-in `/command` interface with autocomplete, option validation, and permission gating
- **Auto-registration** — Commands register themselves with Discord on startup; set `GUILD_ID` for instant updates while developing
- **Full moderation suite** — Kick, ban, timeout, mute, warn, purge, nuke, and more
- **Captcha verification** — `/verify` onboarding flow with image captchas, a button panel, modal answer input, per-guild settings, stats, and audit logging
- **Channel management** — Slowmode, lock/unlock, nickname changes
- **Role management** — Add, remove, or toggle roles with a single command
- **Reaction roles** — Assign roles automatically when users react to configured messages
- **Modmail support** — Users DM the bot and staff handle tickets in thread channels
- **Setup wizard** — Configure modmail using `/setup modmail`
- **Backup and restore** — Administrators can snapshot a server with `/backup` and restore it with `/load-backup`
- **Information commands** — Server info, user info, avatar, icon, emoji list, member stats
- **Local database** — SQLite stores user activity, moderation logs, and verification state
- **Role hierarchy protection** — Cannot moderate users or manage roles above your own rank
- **Permission gating** — Each command declares its required permission via `setDefaultMemberPermissions`, plus a runtime safety check
- **Ephemeral errors** — Validation failures reply privately so they don't clutter the channel
- **Error fallback** — Every interaction is wrapped in error handling; the bot stays online even if a single command throws
- **MIT Licensed** — Free to use, modify, and distribute
- **Zero comments** — Clean, self-documenting code

| `/emojilist` | List all server emojis (static and animated) |

### Roles

| Command | Permission | Description |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| `/role action:[add\|remove\|toggle] user:[@user] role:[@role]` | Manage Roles | Add, remove, or toggle a role on a member |

| `/load-backup backup-id:[id]` | Administrator | Restore a previously created backup into the current server |

### Verification

The `/verify` command groups all verification administration into subcommands (requires **Manage Server**). Members verify themselves through the panel button — no command needed.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/verify setup role:[@role] channel:[#channel] log-channel:[#channel]` | Save the verified role, optional panel channel, and optional log channel |
| `/verify settings captcha-length:[4-8] timeout-minutes:[1-30] max-attempts:[1-10] enabled:[true\|false]` | Update verification behavior |

| `/verify stats member:[@user]` | Show guild verification totals, or a single member's state |
| `/verify reset member:[@user] remove-role:[true\|false]` | Clear a member's active challenge and optionally remove the verified role |

When a member presses **Start Verification**, the bot DMs an ephemeral image captcha with **Enter Captcha** and **Refresh Captcha** buttons. Correct answers grant the verified role; challenges expire automatically after the configured timeout. The bot needs the **Manage Roles** permission and its own role must sit above the verified role.

## How Slash Commands Work

Each file in `src/commands/` exports a `data` object (a `SlashCommandBuilder`) and an `execute(interaction)` handler. On startup:

1. `index.js` loads every command file into a `Collection` keyed by command name.
2. The `ready` event collects all command definitions and registers them with Discord:
   - If `GUILD_ID` is set in `.env`, commands register to that single guild and appear **instantly** — ideal for development.
   - If `GUILD_ID` is left blank, commands register **globally** and may take up to ~1 hour to propagate across all servers.
3. When a user runs a command, the `interactionCreate` event looks it up and calls its `execute` handler. The same event also routes verification **button** and **modal** interactions to the verification service.

There is no separate deploy step — registration happens automatically every time the bot starts.

## Database Schema

The bot uses a local SQLite database (`data.db`).

| started / verified / failed / expired / resets / panels_sent | INTEGER | Rolling counters |
| created_at / updated_at | DATETIME | Record timestamps |

### `verify_challenges`
Active captcha challenges, keyed by guild + user.

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|

## Privacy and Terms

The web pages at `/privacy` and `/terms` now explain the bot’s data handling and acceptable use in more detail.

The PeerBox file-transfer site is available at `/peerbox` when the static export is built.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 20.11 or higher
- **Discord Bot Token** — [Create one in the Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Byte-Labs-offical/Server
cd server

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your bot token plus the dashboard auth settings:

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
GUILD_ID=
PORT=3000
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret_here
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your_discord_client_id
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=your_discord_client_secret
DISCORD_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:3000/auth/discord/callback
```

Set `GUILD_ID` to your test server's ID for instant slash command registration, or leave it blank to register globally.

To configure Discord OAuth2, open your application on the Discord Developer Portal and add a Redirect URI matching your callback URL above.

### Running

```bash
# Start the bot
npm start

# Or with auto-restart on file changes
npm run dev
```

On the first successful start you should see a `[COMMANDS] Registered N ... commands` log line. Your slash commands are now available in Discord.

## Bot Configuration

### Required Intents

Enable these in the Discord Developer Portal under **Bot > Privileged Gateway Intents** (only the privileged ones need toggling there):

| Intent | Why it's needed |
|--------|----------------|
| **Guilds** | Server info, channels, roles, slash command delivery |
| **Guild Messages** | User-activity tracking |
| **Guild Members** *(privileged)* | Fetching member info, role hierarchy checks |
| **Guild Moderation** | Audit log events for moderation |
| **Guild Presences** *(privileged)* | Online/offline status for membercount |

> The bot no longer requires the **Message Content** intent — commands are handled entirely through Discord's slash command system.

### Required Permissions

The bot needs these permissions to function fully:

- Send Messages
- Manage Messages (purge)
- Kick Members
- Ban Members
- Moderate Members (timeout/mute)
- Manage Channels (lock, slowmode, nuke)
- Manage Nicknames
- Manage Roles

When inviting the bot, include the `applications.commands` scope so it can register slash commands.

---

## Error Handling

- Every command execution is wrapped in a `try/catch` block in `interactionCreate`
- Errors are logged to the console with timestamps
- If a command fails, an ephemeral error message is sent to the user who ran it
- The bot stays online and fully operational even if a single command errors

---

## Security

- **Role hierarchy protection** — Users cannot moderate or manage roles for members with equal or higher roles
- **Bot role protection** — Commands check if the bot has the required permissions before proceeding
- **Self-target prevention** — Users cannot kick, ban, timeout, or warn themselves
- **Permission gating** — Each command declares its required permission and re-verifies it at runtime
- **Managed role protection** — Bot-managed roles (boosters, bot roles) cannot be modified via the role command
